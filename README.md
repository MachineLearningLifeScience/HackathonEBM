# Debiasing with Energy-Based Models (EBMs)

Train an EBM on your dataset using the provided configurations.

## 📦 Environment

Conda environment (see `environment.yml`):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ebm

# or minimal pip (no CUDA pinning)
pip install torch torchvision lightning hydra-core einops matplotlib wandb
```

> CUDA: the default `environment.yml` pulls `pytorch`/`nvidia` channels. Adjust versions if your GPU/driver requires it.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1) Choose a config

Pick one of the full recipes in `configs/`, for example:

- `configs/mnist_ebm.yaml` — EBM on MNIST with SGLD
- `configs/binary_mnist_iwae.yaml` — IWAE on Binary MNIST
- `configs/mnist_miwae_mcar.yaml` / `mnist_miwae_mnar.yaml` — MIWAE with missingness settings
- `configs/prop_*` — “proportion/bias” variants used for debiasing experiments

### 2) Train

```bash
# Example: EBM on MNIST
python train.py   --config-name mnist_ebm.yaml   train.batch_size=128 train.epochs=300   train.accelerator=cuda train.devices=1   logger.wandb.project=HackathonEBM  # (optional) if W&B is wired in your config
```

**Hydra tips:**  
- Use `--config-name` to select a full recipe in `configs/` (without the path).  
- You can override any dotted key at the CLI, e.g. `optimizer.lr=1e-4` or `data.dataloader.batch_size=64`.  
- Outputs/checkpoints default under `./outputs/<DATE>/<TIME>/` unless overridden by your config.

### 3) Resume / load from checkpoint

```bash
# Continue training from a checkpoint
python train.py --config-name mnist_ebm.yaml train.ckpt_path=path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

# Run a post‑train experiment using a checkpoint
python run_experiment.py   --config-path ./configs --config-name mnist_ebm.yaml   experiment.cfg.ckpt_path=path/to/checkpoint.ckpt
```

> `run_experiment.py` instantiates `experiments/*` with your Hydra config to perform tasks like sampling or evaluation against held‑out splits.

## Current available experiments :

### Proportion variants for debiasing experiments
*A specific callback was created to evaluate the debiasing performance of the EBM during training. A classifier needs to be pretrained using the `src/models/MNIST_Classifier.py` script and the resulting weights need to be provided in the config file. This pretrained classifier is used to classify samples generated by the EBM/VAE during training.*

- `configs/prop_binary_mnist_vae.yaml` : VAE on biased Binary MNIST (baseline for debiasing experiments). The proportions are set such that all digits don't appear equally in the training set. Simplified so that only digits 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 appear in the training set.
- `configs/prop_binary_mnist_ebm_debiasing.yaml` : EBM trained on the data spaced on biased Binary MNIST (with callback to evaluate debiasing), using the VAE above as base model. (Probably need to retrain the VAE as it is not included in the repo)


### Possible future experiments

TODO

---
## TODOs :
- Add a version of the EBM that operates in the latent space of a pretrained VAE (instead of pixel space)
- Add other experiments for simpler datasets (UCI?)
- Try MSE loss with self normalized importance sampling for EBM training
